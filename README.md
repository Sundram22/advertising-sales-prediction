# Advertising Spend vs. Sales Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of advertising expenditure on sales using **Simple Linear Regression**. The dataset consists of advertising budgets allocated to TV, radio, and newspapers, along with recorded sales figures. The objective is to develop a model that predicts future sales based on marketing investments.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset includes **200 observations** with the following columns:
- **TV** (Advertising budget in TV ads)
- **Radio** (Advertising budget in radio ads)
- **Newspaper** (Advertising budget in newspaper ads)
- **Sales** (Target variable - total sales generated)

## ðŸ›  Steps Performed

1. **Business Problem Understanding**
   - Defined problem statement and business relevance.
   
2. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**
   - Checked for missing values, data types, and data inconsistencies.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Used statistical summaries and correlation heatmaps.
   - Visualized data using scatter plots and bar charts.

4. **Model Training**
   - Built a **Simple Linear Regression Model**.
   - Used TV, radio, and newspaper ad spend as independent variables.
   
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model performance using **R-squared, RMSE, and MAE**.
   - Determined the most influential advertising channel.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advertising-sales-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run `Project 1-Simple linear regression.ipynb`.

## ðŸ“¢ Results & Insights
- Successfully predicted sales based on advertising budget.
- **TV advertising** was found to be the most significant factor affecting sales.
- Demonstrated how businesses can optimize their marketing budget using regression analysis.

This project showcases strong data science skills, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, making it a valuable addition to any portfolio!
